# FadeBook
Booking system app
Fadebook is a booking web application inspired by Booksy(https://github.com/Booksy).
For the backend, I will use Express.js, MongoDB and the frontend will be implemented in Typescript using React.js, Passport.js and Oauth2 protocol.
At this stage, the developer's focus is on gaining the confidence to work with Typescript and Oauth2 and build an MVP model.
